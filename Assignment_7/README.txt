# Assignment No. 7 Readme

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for Assignment No. 7, focusing on classification analysis using the Graduate Admissions dataset. The assignment involves building a machine learning model classifier using a Decision Tree algorithm to predict whether a student will get admission or not based on their GRE score and Academic Score.

## Contents
- `classification_decision_tree.py`: Python script containing the implementation of classification using Decision Tree algorithm, including data preprocessing, data preparation (train-test split), model training, evaluation, and visualization of the model's performance.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the assignment, methodology, and instructions for running the code.

## Methodology
1. **Data Pre-processing**:
   - Perform label encoding for categorical variables (if any) to convert them into numerical format.
   - Check for missing values and handle them using techniques like imputation or deletion.
   - Scale or normalize the numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
2. **Data Preparation (Train-Test Split)**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on a subset of the data and evaluate its performance on unseen data.
   - Typically, around 70-80% of the data is used for training, and the remaining 20-30% is used for testing.
3. **Applying Machine Learning Algorithm (Decision Tree)**:
   - Use scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier` to train the model on the training data.
   - Decision trees are chosen due to their simplicity and interpretability.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Plot the confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model in terms of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Advantages**:
  - Interpretability: Decision trees are easy to interpret and understand, suitable for explaining classification decisions.
  - Non-linear Relationships: Decision trees can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
  - Feature Importance: Decision trees provide information about feature importance, aiding in feature selection.
- **Disadvantages & Limitations**:
  - Overfitting: Decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially when the tree depth is not properly controlled.
  - Instability: Decision trees are sensitive to small changes in the data, leading to different trees for similar datasets.
  - Limited Expressiveness: Decision trees may not perform well on complex datasets with intricate relationships between features.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, employing decision tree classification on the admission dataset offers a straightforward approach to predicting students' admission likelihood based on GRE and academic scores. Despite its simplicity and interpretability, decision trees may suffer from overfitting and sensitivity to data variations. However, they provide valuable insights into feature importance and decision-making processes, aiding counselors in making informed admission decisions. The provided Python script demonstrates the implementation of decision tree classification and model evaluation for effective admission prediction.

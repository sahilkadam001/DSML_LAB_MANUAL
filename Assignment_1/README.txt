# Assignment No. 1 Readme

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for Assignment No. 1, focusing on performing various data manipulation operations using Python. The assignment includes tasks such as reading data from different formats, indexing and selecting data, sorting data, describing attributes of data, checking data types, counting unique values, converting variable data types, identifying and filling missing values.

## Contents
- `assignment.py`: Python script containing the code for performing the assigned tasks.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample datasets in different formats (e.g., CSV, XLS) for demonstration purposes.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the assignment and instructions for running the code.

## Tasks Covered
1. **Reading Data from Different Formats**: Utilizing Python's pandas library to read data from CSV and Excel files.
2. **Indexing and Selecting Data, Sorting Data**: Using pandas for indexing, selecting, and sorting data.
3. **Describing Attributes of Data, Checking Data Types**: Employing pandas' `info()` function to describe data attributes and checking data types.
4. **Counting Unique Values, Converting Variable Data Type**: Utilizing pandas' `value_counts()` function for counting unique values and `astype()` function for converting data types.
5. **Identifying Missing Values and Filling in Missing Values**: Using pandas' `isnull()` function for identifying missing values and `fillna()` function for filling them.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Advantages**: Python offers a rich library like pandas for efficient data manipulation, flexibility in handling various data formats, high performance for large datasets, extensive documentation, and community support.
- **Disadvantages & Limitations**: Learning curve for beginners, occasional package compatibility issues, syntax differences between languages, and varying performance depending on the task.

## Conclusion
This assignment demonstrates the capability of Python, particularly using the pandas library, for performing essential data manipulation tasks efficiently. The provided code and documentation serve as a reference for understanding and implementing similar operations in real-world scenarios.
